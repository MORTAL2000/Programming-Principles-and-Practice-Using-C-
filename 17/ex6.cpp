/* Chapter 17 Exercise 6
This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory using new. Thatâ€™s called memory exhaustion. Find out what happens. 
You have two obvious alternatives: look for documentation, or write a program with an infinite loop that allocates but never deallocates. 
Try both. Approximately how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing?
